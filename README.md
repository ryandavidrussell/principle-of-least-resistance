*A Universal Log-Periodic Signal in Fundamental Physics*

---

## Overview

This repository hosts the reproducibility kit for the Principle of Least Resistance (PLR) framework â€”  
a proposed unifying dynamical principle in physics that predicts universal log-periodic structures.  

The repo provides:
- LaTeX manuscripts and appendices
- Figure definitions and data pipelines
- Packaging scripts for preregistration and Zenodo archives
- Integrity manifests and CI workflows

Its purpose is to make every result in the PLR framework **transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable**.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and build the preregistration and Zenodo bundles:

```bash
make prereg-pack         # prereg bundle (no raw data)
make prereg-pack-data    # prereg bundle (with raw data)
make zenodo-pack         # Zenodo bundle (no raw data)
make zenodo-pack-data    # Zenodo bundle (with raw data)
