  "description": "This record contains the preregistered supplemental material for *The Principle of Least Resistance: A Unified Framework for Physics from First Principles*. The archive includes figures, PDFs, manifests, and scripts required to reproduce the analyses.\n\n**Data Availability and Verification.\u2014**  \nAll supplemental bundles are provided as self-verifying archives. Each file is accompanied by a SHA256 checksum manifest, and integrity can be confirmed by running the included script (`make verify-archive`) or manually with `sha256sum -c`. Packaging is declared complete only when all files pass verification, ensuring referees and readers can independently confirm the consistency of the material.",
