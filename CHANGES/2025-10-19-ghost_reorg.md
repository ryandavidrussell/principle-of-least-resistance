# Ghost Reorganization - Safety and Diagnostics Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-19

## Overview

This change addresses a critical structural inconsistency in the repository where Python scripts were located in the root directory while the `Makefile` expected them to be in a `scripts/` subdirectory. This "ghost reorganization" safely moves all scripts to their proper location and improves diagnostics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

**Problem:** Python utility scripts (`check_summary.py`, `make_checksums.py`, `prereg_pack.py`, `verify_archive.py`, `zenodo_pack.py`, `zenodo_preflight.py`) were located in the repository root, but the `Makefile` references them as `scripts/*.py`.

**Solution:** Created `scripts/` directory and moved all Python scripts to their expected location.

**Files Moved:**
- `check_summary.py` → `scripts/check_summary.py`
- `make_checksums.py` → `scripts/make_checksums.py`
- `prereg_pack.py` → `scripts/prereg_pack.py`
- `verify_archive.py` → `scripts/verify_archive.py`
- `zenodo_pack.py` → `scripts/zenodo_pack.py`
- `zenodo_preflight.py` → `scripts/zenodo_preflight.py`

### 2. Safety Improvements

- **Path Resolution:** The scripts already use `pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` to determine the repository root, making them location-independent and safe to move.
- **No Import Dependencies:** Scripts are standalone utilities with no cross-imports, eliminating risk of broken import paths.
- **Makefile Compatibility:** No changes needed to `Makefile` as it already expected scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

### 3. Diagnostics Improvements

- **Consistent Structure:** Repository now matches the expected structure documented in `FILE_LISTING.txt`.
- **Clearer Organization:** Scripts are now properly organized in a dedicated directory, improving maintainability.
- **Build Reliability:** Eliminates potential confusion and errors from the inconsistent file locations.

## Verification

The reorganization maintains full backward compatibility:
- All scripts use relative path resolution from their own location
- Makefile targets work without modification
- Build and packaging workflows remain functional

## Impact

**Before:** Scripts in root, Makefile expects `scripts/` → Build commands would fail
**After:** Scripts in `scripts/`, Makefile expects `scripts/` → Build commands work correctly

This change resolves the structural issue and ensures the repository can be built and packaged as intended by the `Makefile` targets.
